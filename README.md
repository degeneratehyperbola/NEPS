An open source bloat-free CS:GO cheat for Windows, based on Osiris. You should probably give it a go, as it was in development for about a year. With many, MANY features added, many, MANY fixes pushed (even the ones CS:GO itself needed), many, MANY optimizations and more!

### Some NEPS features:

# NEPS O_O
This software is optimized as far as I was able to keep it clean.
As a proud owner of a 2013 thinkpad, I think I did a so-far-so-good job at making anyone's CS:GO experience with NEPS, at least, not as stuttery and laggy.

# How to use NEPS?
If you are not a nerd, than good for you as it is pretty simple to get started!

### Step-by-step:
- Download a release NEPS loader (NLoader.exe under assets)

[![DOWNLOAD BUTTON](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20-Download-orange?style=plastic)](https://github.com/degeneratehyperbola/NEPS/releases/latest)

- Place it somewhere memorable ;)
- Open CS:GO
- Run the loader with administrator privileges<sup>*</sup>
- By default menu key is set to DEL on the number pad
- *Voila!*

## <sup>*</sup>Concerned?
### Feel free to compile your own version of NEPS loader! Source code of it is available right in this repository.
