An open source bloat-free CS:GO cheat for Windows, based on Osiris. You should probably give it a go, as it was in development for about a year. With many, MANY features added, many, MANY fixes pushed (even the ones CS:GO itself needed), many, MANY optimizations and more!

# NEPS O_O
This cheat is optimized as far as I was able to keep it clean.
As a proud owner of a 2013 thinkpad, I think I did a so-far-so-good job at making anyone's CS:GO experience with NEPS, at least, not as stuttery and laggy.

# NEPS features
- Aimbot: aim assistance
- Triggerbot: automatically shoot a player if in front of crosshair
- Backtrack: abuse lag compensation to interact with opponent's previous records
- Anti-aim: a tool to make you harder to hit, sometimes exploiting server-client desynchronization bug
- Chams or Chameleons: color and shade any model in a world to your liking (also can indicate backtrack and anti-aim)
- Glow: similarly to chams creates a glowing halo around models
- ESP or Extra Sensory Perception: reveal critical info about players
- Visuals: modify visual aspects of the game to your liking
- Skin Changer: equip any in-game weapon/player skin
- Sound: modulate any sound individually
- Griefing: toolset for trolling/griefing players
- Exploits: abuse miscellaneous bugs of the game
- Movement: movement enhancement
- Misc: miscellaneous features that didn't get categorized, try them out among others!
- Style: customize the look of NEPS main menu
- Config: save and load configurations for every feature
